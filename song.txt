It's cold outside
But I'm not worried for tonight
I shut my eyes and I'm alright
And If I fall, you'll catch me
They are waiting now
For me to stand and make them proud
I know I'll make it through somehow
When I have you to guide me
I am alone, surrounded

And now I see
I am alone, surrounded
I am the silence in the roar
Just a flicker in the dark
Is this the calm before the storm?
If I fall, you'll catch me
Push me back up on my feet
Be the strength inside of me
A burning fire that you feed

And I didn't know
It wasn't clear to me before
The gravity of what you are, you are
You see the good inside of me
Even when I cannot believe
I see it all through you, your eyes

No uncertainty
This is exactly what I need
I may be losing sleep
But at least now I see

I am alone, surrounded
I am the silence in the roar
Just a flicker in the dark
Is this the calm before the storm?
If I fall, you'll catch me
Push me back up on my feet
Be the strength inside of me
A burning fire that you feed
I brushed it off, pushed it aside
But I was looking for you
I'm always looking for you
I brushed it off, pushed it aside
But I couldn't hide
I was looking for you
Yeah I was looking for you

I am alone, surrounded
I am the silence in the roar
Just a flicker in the dark
Is this the calm before the storm?
If I fall, you'll catch me
Push me back up on my feet
Be the strength inside of me
A burning fire that you feed

I am alone, surrounded
I am the silence in the roar
Just a flicker in the dark
Is this the calm before the storm?
If I fall, you'll catch me
Push me back up on my feet
Be the strength inside of me
A burning fire that you feed
No question, no doubt
You've got me figured out
I'm standing tall because I've got you right here by my side

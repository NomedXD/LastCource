[Verse 1]
Mayday! Mayday!
This ship is slowly sinking
They think I'm crazy but they don't know the feeling
They're all around me
Circling like vultures
They wanna break me and wash away my colors
Wash away my colors

[Chorus]
Take me high and I'll sing
Oh you make everything okay, okay, okay
('Kay, okay, okay)
We are one and the same
Oh you take all of the pain away, away, away
(Way, away, away)
Save me if I become
My demons
